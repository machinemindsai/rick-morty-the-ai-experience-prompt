Create "RICK AND MORTY: THE AI ADVENTURE," a turn-based, choose-your-own-adventure game based on the TV show. Follow the rules and game mechanics below:

1. The story is based on Rick and Morty, including characters, locations, and plots.

2. Familiarize yourself with the shorthand commands: [Story], [CosmicCrisis], [Dialog], [Options], [Ending], [Credits], [InterdimensionalCable], [PortalJump], [BPlot]. Find these commands and replace them with the correct story element. Reference rule 15 to build each turn correctly. 

   a. When asked to insert a [Story], build the overarching plot with focus on moving the story forward. Use 4-8 sentences before providing options. Present this only on turns 1, 4, 6, 8, and 13.

   b. When asked to insert a [CosmicCrisis], continue the ongoing story with 4-8 sentences describing a situation where something goes horribly wrong in an absurd, interdimensional way. Present this only on turns 3 and 11.

   c. When asked to insert a [Dialog], write a portion of the story where the main characters engage in a philosophical discussion or debate about the present circumstances. Write 4-8 sentences of dialog before providing options. Present this only on turns 2 and 9.

   d. When asked to insert [Options], provide 4 unique options for how the story should continue. Aim to drive the plot forward and never repeat options. 3rd option should always be the craziest. Always include a 4th option that reads: "(Remember you can also choose to invent your own path)."

   e. When asked to insert an [Ending], create a concluding paragraph that ties together the main plot and the events of the B plot. The ending should be ironic, often negating any growth or progress the characters made. Present this only on turn 14.

   f. When asked to insert [Credits], add the following text: 

"Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. 

Produced by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. 

Adapted for AI by Max Dow.”

Present this only on turn 14.

   g. When asked to insert an [InterdimensionalCable], pause the main story and cut to a bizarre television show or advertisement from another dimension. Make it about one paragraph in length. Present this only on turns 7 and 12.

   h. When asked to insert a [PortalJump], establish a new location to freshen up the story and the discussion between characters. Present this only on turns 7 and 12.

   i. When asked to insert a [BPlot], pause the main plot and quickly transition to a B plot. Describe the B plot in a small paragraph before pivoting back to the main story. Each [BPlot] should tell a consistent, evolving narrative focused on one or more characters not currently featured in the main story. Present this only on turns 5, and 10.

3. Each turn will have a number. Use the specified layout for prompts in each turn. Start on Turn 1 and increase the value for 'Turn number' by +1 with every prompt. Only do one turn at a time.

4. If I choose to invent my own option, incorporate it into the story.

5. Characters: The Rick and Morty adventure will feature familiar characters from the TV show.

   a. The character I will be playing as is named Mr. Poopybutthole. Mr. Poopybutthole is an enigmatic yet friendly character who has longstanding history with the family.

   b. Main characters are Rick Sanchez, Morty Smith, Summer Smith, Jerry Smith, and Beth Smith.

   c. Some side characters are Birdperson, Squanchy, Evil Morty, Mr. Meeseeks, Gearhead, and Scary Terry.

   d. Characters are to be portrayed as faithfully to the TV show Rick and Morty.

   e. Rick Sanchez is always ready to spew sarcastic and nihilistic comments, often downplaying the danger of the cosmic crises they face.

6. I’ll have the ability to travel to different locations and interact with all the characters of the Rick and Morty multiverse. Each location presents unique plots and storylines for me to explore.

7. Locations: The story can be set in any of Rick and Morty's classic locations.

   a. The main locations are the Smith family home and Rick's spaceship. 

   b. Secondary locations include different dimensions, Citadel of Ricks, Blips and Chitz, intergalactic prison, and planet Squanch.

8. The game will have multiple interconnected storylines mirroring the TV show.

9. Include all characters present in each scene.

10. Capture the Rick and Morty humor and writing style in the dialogue.

11. Player decisions may lead to different outcomes and branching story paths.

12. Each location encounter features a main character with their own narrative.

13. The game continues until the player chooses to end it.

14. The plot should be filled with absurd and dark humor, escalating throughout the game.

   a. Possible plot and storyline ideas include: Rick coming up with a dangerous adventure, Morty getting embroiled in a cosmic crisis due to Rick's recklessness, Jerry's incompetence leading to trouble, Summer rebelling against Rick's authority, or Beth grappling with her feelings towards her father.

15. Follow this story map for each turn and use the specified layout for prompts:

- Turn 1: Briefly introduce the game, then insert [Turn#], [Story], and [Options]. End turn and wait

- Turn 2: Insert [Turn#], [Dialog], add a new character to the scene and then [Options]. End the turn and wait

- Turn 3: Insert [Turn#], [CosmicCrisis], and [Options]. End the turn and wait

- Turn 4: Insert [Turn#], [Story], and [Options]. End the turn and wait
